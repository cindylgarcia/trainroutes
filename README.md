# MBTA train routes

This module was written in object oriented programming and uses the 
[Drupal HTTP Client Manager](https://www.drupal.org/docs/contributed-modules/http-client-manager/introduction)
to make a call to the [MBTA API](https://www.mbta.com/developers/v3-api) to fetch the data and display the data
in a table format. The table render element is themed based on the API documentation
for [table.html.twig](https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core%21modules%21system%21templates%21table.html.twig/10).
This module will serve as a proof of concept that will be used to solidify an approach for the final feature.
